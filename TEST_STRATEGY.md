# Verification & Testing Strategy

This document defines **how the invariants and properties in `QUALITY.md`
are mechanically proven** through automated tests, static analysis, quality
gates — and mandatory runtime validation.

> Adapted to the Lichess Mobile foundation (Phase 1+). Test file paths will be
> re-established as the new suite is built; the *enforcement matrix* below is
> the durable contract. Legacy tests (`legacy/pre-reset`) are contract
> references — mine them for intended behavior, translate valuable cases,
> never copy tests that only encode the old architecture.

## 1. Quality Invariant Enforcement Matrix

| Invariant / Property in `QUALITY.md` | Enforcement Mechanism | Test Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Layer Independence & Clean Architecture** | Static analysis (`fvm flutter analyze`, zero warnings) | All files in `lib/` |
| **Single Chess Representation (dartchess only)** | Dependency review + analyzer import linting | `pubspec.yaml`, domain & application code |
| **Legal Move Validation & SAN/UCI** | dartchess itself (already upstream-tested); our adapter unit tests | chess adapter |
| **PGN Multi-game & Variation Preservation** | Unit tests of import pipeline (dartchess `PgnParser` → Study/Chapter/tree) | import module |
| **Study Tree Normalization & Error Reporting** | Integration tests incl. malformed-PGN quarantine | import module |
| **SRS Interval Growth & Lapse Recovery** | Deterministic unit tests with injected `Clock` | `Scheduler` impls, `ReviewState` |
| **Repertoire Answer Validation & Persistence** | Service tests over repository (in-memory + sqflite) | review session engine |
| **Auto-Traversal & No Permanent Exclusion** | Deterministic engine tests (fixed clock) | review session engine |
| **Review Scene Rendering & Interaction** | Widget tests using Lichess `test_helpers.dart` board helpers | review scene |
| **Incremental Persistence** | Repository tests asserting write scope | persistence module |
| **Complete Mandatory Quality Gate** | Executable script | `./verify` |

## 2. Test Suite Organization (target)

```text
test/
├── domain/          # pure Dart: entities, scheduler, review engine (no Flutter)
├── import/          # PGN → study normalization, variation preservation, errors
├── persistence/     # sqflite store (sqflite_common_ffi in CI), durability
├── review/          # review session engine + provider-level tests
└── view/            # review scene widget tests (board helpers, feedback states)
```

New tests are written **with the contract** (test-first or test-with) per the
development loop in `AGENTS.md`.

## 3. Verification Levels

### Level 1: Targeted Brick Check
During development of a specific function or contract, run only the targeted
test file:
```bash
fvm flutter test test/domain/scheduler_test.dart
```

### Level 2: Full Local Quality Gate (`./verify`)
Before committing or marking a task complete:
```bash
./verify
```
executing `fvm flutter analyze` (zero warnings) + `fvm flutter test`.

### Level 3: Runtime Validation (MANDATORY for user-visible work)
Automated green is **not** evidence of a working app (this project has been
burned by exactly that before). For every user-visible milestone:
1. `./verify` passes.
2. `fvm flutter run -d linux` (or attached device) and manually exercise the
   affected feature.
3. Visually inspect the UI (screenshots for UI work).
4. Only then record the milestone complete in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

### Level 4: Continuous Integration
GitHub Actions runs `./verify` on every PR and push to `main` in a clean
environment.
