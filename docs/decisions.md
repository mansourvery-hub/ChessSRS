# Architecture and Product Decisions

This file records decisions that should not be silently reversed during implementation.

## D001 — Review is the primary application

Decision: The app is Review-first. There is no conventional dashboard/product hierarchy.

Reason: The product's value is active repertoire recall, not study management.

Implication: Studies/openings are lightweight selectors that constrain Review.

## D002 — Local-first Review

Decision: The critical Review loop never requires the network.

Reason: The user must be able to play at thought speed and offline.

Implication: Local chess validation, repertoire lookup, and SRS updates happen locally.

## D003 — PGN is an input format, not the domain model

Decision: Normalize PGN into Study/Chapter/PositionNode/RepertoireDecision structures.

Reason: Future Lichess import and other sources must converge on one model.

## D004 — Study and opening are different concepts

Decision: A Study is a source/content container. An Opening is a cross-study classification/filter.

Reason: Users may want to review one opening across many studies.

## D005 — Engine is advisory, not the Review judge

Decision: Review correctness is repertoire-based.

Reason: The purpose is remembering the user's preparation, including how to punish opponent mistakes.

## D006 — One-time import analysis may warn about user-side aberrations

Decision: A future import-time engine pass may identify severe user-side evaluation collapses.

Rules: warn only; never block import; do not treat opponent inaccuracies as repertoire defects.

## D007 — Learned does not mean forgotten forever

Decision: Auto-traversed/non-due decisions remain scheduled and can become due again after long intervals.

Reason: Long-term retention requires eventual retrieval practice.

## D008 — No mandatory session completion

Decision: Review has no end-of-session page.

Reason: Artificial session boundaries add product weight without improving the core interaction.

## D009 — Future sync covers both studies and SRS state

Decision: Cloud synchronization should eventually cover both repertoire content and review state.

Reason: Both are small enough and both are required for a coherent cross-device experience.

## D010 — Reference repositories

Decision: Use `ZackMurry/chessrs` and `ArneVogel/listudy` as explicit implementation references.

Links:

- https://github.com/ZackMurry/chessrs
- https://github.com/ArneVogel/listudy

Reason: They provide relevant prior art for chess SRS and study/tree training behaviour.

## D011 — No premature feature expansion

Decision: New features need a product justification tied to repertoire retention/review.

Reason: The product's differentiation depends on focus and speed.

## D012 — Architectural reset to the Lichess Mobile foundation

Decision: The application is rebuilt as a fork of `lichess-org/mobile`
(GPL-3.0). The previous standalone implementation is archived at git tag
`legacy/pre-reset` and is reference material only.

Reason: The old implementation's UI/UX quality could not reach the product's
Lichess-standard requirements without reinventing what Lichess Mobile already
provides (board, theme, navigation, settings, persistence patterns).

Implication: Domain contracts are specified by the Markdown documents and
reimplemented cleanly inside the Lichess architecture. Old code is never
resurrected because class names look familiar.

## D013 — dartchess is the single chess representation

Decision: Use dartchess (the chess library of the Lichess ecosystem) for all
rules, FEN, SAN, UCI, and PGN parsing. chessground renders boards.

Reason: QUALITY.md forbids duplicated chess logic; the old `package:chess`
adapter is obsolete in the new foundation.

## D014 — Listudy behavior only, never code (AGPL)

Decision: Listudy (AGPL-3.0) serves as behavioral reference only. chessrs
(GPL-3.0) permits attributed adaptation, but reimplementation is preferred.

Reason: License incompatibility with our GPL-3.0 fork for direct AGPL reuse.

## D015 — Pure Binary FSRS over Latency Grading

Decision: Grade move recall strictly as binary Pass/Fail (`Rating.good` vs `Rating.again`), completely excluding response latency from interval calculations.

Reason: Chess recall is fundamentally different from vocabulary flashcards. In chess, stopping to verify candidate moves, calculate tactical variations, and check piece safety is disciplined play. Penalizing thinking time builds toxic habits (reflexive blitzing, clock panic) and penalizes deep verification. FSRS maintains its full mathematical predictive power in binary mode ($R = (1 + F \cdot t/S)^C$, $R_{\text{target}}$ solving), while keeping move input 100% natural chess without clock anxiety.

Rules:
1. `Rating.good`: First committed move on the board is correct, regardless of thinking duration.
2. `Rating.again`: Incorrect move, hint used, or a corrected false-start attempt.
3. Latency is demoted from a scheduling input to an optional analytics metric (`latencyEmaMs`), strictly firewalled from interval computation.
