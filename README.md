# ChessSRS

**A local-first chess repertoire + spaced-repetition trainer**, built as a
fork of [Lichess Mobile](https://github.com/lichess-org/mobile) (GPL-3.0).

> Give the player a position from their own repertoire and ask them to play
> what they have learned.

- Import your PGN studies (variations, comments, NAGs, custom FENs).
- Review due positions on a Lichess-quality board.
- Spaced repetition schedules what you see next — learned moves return when
  they're due again.
- Everything runs locally; no account, no network on the training path.

## Status

Foundation phase — the app is the Lichess Mobile foundation with product
specifics under active development. See `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

## Development

```bash
fvm flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build     # after model/codegen changes
fvm flutter analyze
fvm flutter test
fvm flutter run -d linux
```

`./verify` runs the quality gate (analyze + tests).
